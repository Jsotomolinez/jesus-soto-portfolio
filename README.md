# 👋 Hello!

## 🌟 This was CS50!

### ✨ My name is Jesús Soto
I am a **💻 software developer** and a **⚗️ chemical engineering student** from **🇻🇪 Venezuela**.

🚀 I started programming during my time at university, where I discovered my passion for coding. Later, I decided to deepen my knowledge by taking the **📚 CS50 courses** from Harvard University, which helped me build a strong foundation in computer science and programming.

🌱 I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies to improve my skills and create impactful projects. My goal is to combine my knowledge of **engineering** and **programming** to solve real-world problems. 🌍

### 🖥️ About this project:
This is not just my personal webpage, but also my **final project submission** for **CS50x**! 🎓  
Through this project, I combined my passion for programming and the skills I gained during the **CS50 courses** to create something meaningful and personal. 💡

This project was built using **TypeScript** 🟦, **React** ⚛️, **Next.js** ⏭️, and **shadcn** 🎨, which I customized to fit the needs of my portfolio. I chose these technologies to align with the current trends in web development 🌐 and to ensure a modern, efficient, and scalable design 🚀. By leveraging these tools, I was able to create a responsive 📱 and dynamic 💫 user experience that reflects my skills and adaptability in the ever-evolving field of web development 🔧.

#### 🛠️ Backend Development Journey:
In addition to honing my frontend skills, I have also delved into the world of **backend development**. 🌐  
I expanded my knowledge by learning **Python** and working with **FastAPI**, a modern and fast web framework for building APIs. 🐍⚡  

Through this journey, I gained valuable experience in designing and implementing RESTful APIs, managing server-side logic, and ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend. This has allowed me to create more robust and full-stack applications, further enhancing my ability to tackle complex projects. 💻🔗  

By combining my backend expertise with my frontend skills, I strive to deliver complete and efficient solutions that meet the needs of users and stakeholders. 🚀✨

### 📂 Project Structure: Why is it organized this way? 🤔

The structure of this project was designed to ensure clarity, scalability, and maintainability. Here's a brief explanation of the main folders:

- **`components/ui`**: This folder contains reusable UI components, such as buttons, modals, or form elements. By organizing them here, we ensure consistency across the application and make it easier to manage and reuse these elements. 🧩

- **`app/hooks`**: This folder is dedicated to custom React hooks. Hooks encapsulate reusable logic, making the codebase cleaner and more modular. For example, a hook might handle form validation or fetch data from an API. 🔄

- **`app/actions`**: This folder contains functions or utilities that handle specific actions, such as API calls or state updates. Keeping these actions separate helps maintain a clear separation of concerns and makes the code easier to test and debug. ⚙️

By structuring the project this way, we ensure that each part of the application has a clear purpose, making it easier to navigate and extend as the project grows. 🚀
